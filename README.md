# Ear-training

## Description
The purpose of this program is to be used for ear training. For many musicians, itâ€™s important to be able to identify different musical intervals and chord types (and their inversions) by ear. This program would work for these 13 different intervals:
1. Minor 2nd
2. Major 2nd
3. Minor 3rd
4. Major 3rd
5. Perfect 4th
6. Perfect 5th
7. Minor 6th
8. Major 6th
9. Minor 7th
10. Major 7th
11. Octave
12. Diminished
13. Augmented
    
And 9 different chord types (for triads and seven chords):
1. Major
2. Minor
3. Diminished
4. Augmented
5. Major seven
6. Minor Seven
7. Diminished Seven
8. Half-diminished seven
9. Dominant Seven

And lastly the possible inversions:
1. Root
2. First
3. Second
4. Third (seven chords only)

## Usage
Users will have the option of guessing a randomized interval or chord (which will be played), as well as inputting a specific interval or chord to be heard. The program will verify the corectness of a user's guess, and output the notes used.
